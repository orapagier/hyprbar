# Daily-driver Settings roadmap

Recorded 2026-10-09. Updated 2026-10-10.

Goal: make Hyprshell usable every day by beginners and intermediate users,
with common tasks available through Settings rather than editing Lua.

Existing foundations: Wi-Fi, Bluetooth pairing, audio output selection,
screenshots, editable shortcuts, screen locking, cleanup, and GitHub config sync.

## Priorities

1. **Displays** — resolution, refresh rate, scaling, monitor arrangement,
   rotation, and timed rollback for unconfirmed changes. Implemented 2026-10-09;
   physical monitor testing remains because the agent session cannot access desktop IPC.
2. **Mouse, touchpad and keyboard** — pointer speed, natural scrolling,
   tap-to-click, keyboard layouts, repeat speed, and layout switching. Implemented
   2026-10-10; physical device testing remains.
3. **Power and battery** — dim/off timers, automatic suspend, lid behavior,
   brightness, and supported power profiles. Implemented 2026-10-10; locking
   remains separate. Physical suspend/lid/wake testing remains.
4. **Notifications** — optional popups, Do Not Disturb, per-app preferences,
   and critical alerts. Implemented 2026-10-10; popups default off.
   Physical delivery and popup placement testing remains.
5. **Sound improvements** — microphone device selection, input meter,
   test sound, and per-app volume. Implemented 2026-10-10; physical audio
   and device persistence testing remains.
6. **Default apps and startup** — browser, file associations, startup toggles,
   and GTK/Qt theme, font, and cursor controls.
7. **Updates and recovery** — guided full system upgrades, useful failure
   messages, configuration restore, and personal-file backup status.
   GitHub config sync does not back up documents.
8. **Advanced networking** — saved-network management, hidden Wi-Fi,
   enterprise connections, VPN, and access to advanced connection settings.
9. **Accessibility and regional settings** — larger text, high contrast,
   reduced motion, language, timezone, and date/number formats.
10. **Help and diagnostics** — Settings search, first-run guide, useful service
    errors, and privacy-conscious diagnostic reports. Super+K already provides
    a shortcut guide.

Intermediate-user follow-ups: window rules and behavior, workspace preferences,
clipboard history controls, and printing/scanning access.

Suggested order: Displays → Input → Power → Notifications → Recovery.
Current personal automatic-lock timeout is 60 minutes; consider shorter presets.

## Displays acceptance criteria

- Discover connected monitors and advertised modes; show actionable errors.
- Edit resolution/refresh, scale, rotation and logical X/Y positions.
- Explicit Apply; keep changes only after confirmation within 15 seconds.
- Restore previous live layout on timeout, cancellation or UI shutdown.
- Save confirmed preferences, back up replaced files and detect concurrent edits.
- Preserve installer and GitHub sync behavior; retain automatic fallback for new hardware.
- Test transactions in isolated environments; test native QML and verify Lua.
- Physical monitor behavior must be checked in an accessible desktop session.

## Handoff for tomorrow

Displays now has advertised resolution/refresh controls, scale, rotation, automatic
arrangement, relative placement buttons, and precise X/Y fields. Apply previews the
layout; Keep commits it, with a 15-second backend timeout and rollback. Installer
and sync preserve confirmed settings. See `docs/settings.md` for implementation
limits and usage.

First check the Displays page on the real laptop (and an external screen if
available): confirm a change, allow a timeout, then check restart persistence.
The automated suite uses isolated settings and simulated compositor responses.
Priority 2 is now implemented; see the input handoff below.

Validation: 11 display checks passed (including native QML and real Lua parsing),
140 existing Qt tests passed, and native Settings lifecycle/autosave checks passed.
The broader Python run passed 81 of 82 checks; the unrelated shortcut-recording
check references a missing `config/quickshell/tests/ShortcutRecording.qml` fixture.
Native runtime dependency checks passed. Live monitor IPC was inaccessible.

Displays follow-up: fixed `hyprctl eval` rejecting a leading Lua comment as a CLI
flag. Runtime snippets now start with executable Lua; saved files keep their
header. Errors remain red after automatic refresh and command-help dumps are
replaced by concise messages. All 13 display regression checks pass, including
real CLI argument parsing in an isolated runtime. Physical preview still needs
verification in the desktop session.

The 5-percentage-point scale slider was reverted after physical testing showed
errors at values such as 105% and 110%. Scaling uses the previous preset dropdown. The laptop panel's kernel mode list reports only
1920×1080; resolution choices continue to use advertised modes.

Application theme is now available separately from topbar appearance: Dark/Light
updates desktop and GTK preferences and enables GTK integration for newly opened
Qt applications. Saved mode travels through setup and GitHub sync. Native toggle
and transaction checks cover failure recovery and unchanged bar preferences.

Launcher follow-up: desktop entries now launch through UWSM services so they
inherit the updated Qt theme environment and honor Terminal=true. UWSM's default
terminal selection chose Kitty's URL launcher; xdg-terminals.list now prefers the
real Kitty terminal. Real command generation resolves Vim to `kitty -- vim`.
Vim opened normally in an isolated PTY. GParted's installed wrapper expects
xhost, which is absent; xorg-xhost was added to packages.txt. Live installation
requires `sudo pacman -S --needed xorg-xhost` from the user's terminal because the
agent session cannot elevate privileges. Confirm remaining light apps by name.

Confirmed light apps: GParted and About Xfce. Both link GTK 3. Scoped themed
launcher entries now read the saved mode on each launch. About Xfce gets an
explicit GTK variant; GParted gets it after normal administrator authentication,
with temporary root-only display access and the upstream wrapper preserved.
Automated tests cover dark/light, argument boundaries, cancellation/error cleanup,
and preservation of existing display permissions. Check visual results by fully
closing and reopening these apps from the launcher in the desktop session.

## Input handoff — 2026-10-10

Settings → Mouse & keyboard now includes pointer speed, independent mouse and
touchpad natural scrolling, tap-to-click, disabling touchpad while typing,
common/custom keyboard layouts, layout-switch shortcuts, repeat speed/delay,
and a temporary typing test field. Preferences inherit existing input config
until edited, and each override can be removed. Device-specific rules can
still take priority. Switching overrides the existing XKB options; variants
remain configured in input.lua.

Repository and live Quickshell payloads are updated together. Setup regenerates
GUI overrides from saved settings, including input and appearance preferences,
so the existing GitHub snapshot is restorable. Physical input testing remains
because desktop IPC is inaccessible from the agent session.

Next: check input controls on the laptop. Priority 3 is now implemented below.
Validation: 21 settings backend checks, 15 installer checks, 147 Qt checks,
3 native Settings lifecycle/autosave checks, and native runtime dependencies.

## Power handoff — 2026-10-10

Settings → Power & battery now has battery status, live backlight adjustment,
dim/off/suspend timers, dimmed brightness, session lid behavior, and supported
power-profile preferences. Timers default off; lid and profile default to system
control. Existing personal locking settings are preserved. Power and locking
share one Hypridle process; closing Settings leaves them running. AC/battery
specific timer policies are a follow-up.

Managed dimming restores previous brightness on activity, settings changes, or
normal shell shutdown, while preserving manual adjustments. Screen-off uses
Lua DPMS and wakes on activity. Custom lid behavior uses a session logind
inhibitor with hardware-adaptive kernel lid discovery, without administrator
configuration changes. Saved timers/lid/profile choices travel through setup
and GitHub sync; immediate brightness changes and temporary snapshots do not.

Validation: 17 power helper/supervisor checks, 1 native power UI/controller
check, 21 settings checks, 6 locking checks, 1 native locking-controller check,
3 native Settings checks, 15 installer checks, 10 GitHub-sync checks, and 147 Qt
checks passed. Native Hypridle parsing and runtime dependency checks passed.
Live backlight and lid-sensor discovery succeeded. Power-profile D-Bus and
Hyprland IPC remain inaccessible in the agent session.

Next: test brightness restoration, display wake, suspend/resume and lid choices
on the real laptop, then priority 4, Notifications. Check profile selection in
the desktop session. No live dimming, screen-off or suspend test was performed.

Power activation follow-up: a live reload raced the new component copy and
failed with “SettingsPower is not a type”, retaining the old Settings interface.
After confirming all files were present, touching the live shell.qml triggered
a successful reload, verified by the active instance's Configuration Loaded log.
Future payload updates must create dependencies before replacing consumers and
verify activation in the live log.


## Notifications handoff — 2026-10-10

Settings → Notification delivery now offers optional popups, Do Not Disturb,
critical bypass, popup duration, and per-app Follow defaults / Inbox only / Off.
Popups remain disabled by default. Critical alerts can bypass quiet mode when
popups are enabled; explicit per-app choices take precedence. The inbox labels
critical alerts and preserves history when popups close or time out. One top-right
stack shows at most three recent alerts. Critical alerts have no automatic timer;
overflow remains available in the inbox.

Saved preferences use the existing settings transaction, backups, conflict checks,
autosave, installer, and GitHub sync. Reload does not replay tracked notifications
as new popups. Repository and live payloads are updated together, dependencies
before consumers. Notification history was not read or copied to the repository.

Validation: 3 notification backend/native lifecycle checks, 22 settings checks,
153 Qt checks, 3 native Settings lifecycle/autosave checks, 15 installer checks,
10 GitHub-sync checks and native runtime dependencies. Desktop-session D-Bus delivery
and Wayland placement remain untested because the sandbox blocks socket access.

Live activation: the running shell logged Configuration Loaded after the payload
update. No popup preference was enabled during installation.

Next: enable popups on the laptop, send normal and critical alerts with Do Not
Disturb on/off, test per-app preferences, actions, and restart persistence. Then
continue with priority 5, Sound improvements, or Recovery from the suggested order.


## Sound handoff — 2026-10-10

Settings → Sound now includes default output/input selection, master/microphone
volume and mute, a microphone input meter, test sound, and per-application playback
and recording stream volumes. Microphone selection is also in the topbar Audio
menu. A microphone test runs only after starting it and stops on navigation, window
close, or device change. Test sound plays a short quiet tone on the selected output
only when clicked; output changes, page/window close, Stop, and a five-second
watchdog cancel it. No sound or microphone test starts during installation.

Device defaults and volumes use PipeWire/WirePlumber state instead of exporting
hardware names to Hyprshell settings. Setup and GitHub sync preserve the controls
and the packaged waveform; sound system state is not part of config sync. Existing
applications may keep their previous route after changing the default device.

Validation: 160 Qt checks, 2 native tone/waveform checks, 3 native Settings checks,
15 installer checks, 10 GitHub-sync checks, and native runtime dependency checks.
The sandbox cannot access PipeWire; real levels, audible playback, call routing,
and remembered devices/volumes remain untested.

Repository and live payloads are updated together. The running shell logged
Configuration Loaded after activation.

Next: check Sound on the laptop, try a USB/Bluetooth device if available, adjust
an app volume during playback, and check defaults after reconnect/restart. Then
priority 6, Default apps and startup; Recovery remains next in the suggested order.


Sound microphone follow-up — 2026-10-10: the user reported Test microphone did
not work. Replaced the Quickshell monitor with an explicit capture stream on the
selected source. PCM stays in memory; only levels reach the UI. Startup, connection,
and capture errors are now visible, with a five-second no-data startup timeout.
The existing opt-in, page-close, and device-change lifecycle is retained. Four
microphone regression checks cover PCM conversion, active capture arguments,
failures, the actual Loader source path, and process cleanup; Sound Qt and tone
checks pass. Physical microphone behavior still needs a laptop retest.


Microphone full-meter follow-up — 2026-10-10: the user reported a full, stationary
bar even after the capture change. Rendering tests show the bar follows changing
values. The meter now displays RMS average level instead of maximum sample level,
with a separate clipping warning and live percentage. A two-second no-new-data
watchdog clears stale readings and stops capture. Five microphone tests and eight
Sound Qt checks cover sparse spikes, changing rendered fill, clipping, and stalled
capture cleanup. The physical cause and laptop result are still unconfirmed.
